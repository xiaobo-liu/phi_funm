# A Scaling and Recovering Algorithm for the Matrix $\varphi$-Functions

This repository contains the algorithm developed in the technical report:

A. H. Al-Mohy and X. Liu. [*A scaling and recovering algorithm for the matrix Ï†-functions*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01193). ArXiv:2506.01193 [math.NA], September 2025.

## The main function

The code was tested in MATLAB 2024b. 

The main function `phi_funm.m` computes the phi-functions of a matrix for given indices. 

The script `simple_test.m` runs a simple test.
The directory `replication/` contains required subroutines for reproducing the results in the paper.


## Replicating the results in the paper

To reproduce the results in the paper, the following MATLAB toolboxes need to be installed:

- [Advanpix Multiprecision Computing Toolbox](https://www.advanpix.com)

- [Anymatrix](https://github.com/north-numerical-computing/anymatrix)

where in Anymatrix the test matrix collection

- [matrices-expm](https://github.com/xiaobo-liu/matrices-expm)

needs to be incorporated as a group.

The results presented in the manuscript can be generated by running:

```
>> run_all_tests
```
